# ExploitToolBox
This is a work in progress. This includes some basic bash scripting to automate tasks within Linux, Specifically Kali Linux. It acts as a shortcut to launch some basic exploit programs. The second main function of this script is to automate some NMAP scans, by providing a target ip and choosing which option you'd like to use.
